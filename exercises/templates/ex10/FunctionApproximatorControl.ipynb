This topic is still being researched and there are many interesting applications, but most of them are not yet used economically because experts in reinforcement learning are scarce. Control tasks are generally more complex than prediction tasks and we often need to apply domain-specific expert knowledge and very performant algorithms to succeed with function approximators.\n",

    "The use of an appropriate RBF feature engineering enables even a linear agent to solve the MountainCar environment. Since the policy is changing over time, it would be useful to set the $\\lambda$-parameter lower than one. However, this can lead to numeric instability, so this degree of freedom has to be tuned with caution. With $\\lambda=1$, all observations are weighted equally, which does not accurately describe the behavior of our changing policy. Nonetheless, the resulting estimator is able to perform acceptable on-policy control. With a rising number of training episodes, even the $\\lambda=1$ training will converge to the correct action-value eventually (but we do not know how many episodes this may need)."
