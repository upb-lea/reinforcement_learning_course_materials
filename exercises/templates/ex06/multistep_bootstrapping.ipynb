    "In this exercise we will have a look at n-step methods and eligibility trace. The n-step methods are a class of reinforcement learning algorithms that are an abstraction of the Monte Carlo and TD(0) methods discussed earlier and include them as special cases. Furthermore, we also consider the eligibility traces, which take a reverse approach to determining the state values. The environment we will be dealing with is a little more typical for control research: the inverted pendulum. \n",

Contrary to n-step learning, however, intuition tells us that more recent decisions had a more severe impact on the present situation than decisions that were made a long time ago. Thus, it may be helpful to integrate a forgetting factor $\\lambda$ which decreases the assumed influence of actions over time.\n",
