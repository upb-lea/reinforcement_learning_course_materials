    "- `reward`, which will be -1 per step,\n",
    "- `terminated`-flag which indicates if the environment is terminated (in our case if the car has reached the finish line),\n",

This means that this part of the policy accelerates the car to a maximum velocity of ```v_x = 1```. As the car is not affected by this after it is already moving.\n",
    "- ```dummy_slow_pi[:track.bounds[0]//2, -2:, 0, :] = 6```: This part of the policy takes effect when the car is in the upper half of the right boundary of the track. It only affects the car, when there is no vertical velocity (3rd dimension). As the car reaches this area of the space with the velocity ```v_x = 1``` and ```v_y = 0```, the velocity is ```v_x = 0``` and ```v_y = 1``` after this part of the policy was applied once. \n",

It only affects the car, when there is no horizontal velocity (4th dimension).

If one would increase the limit, this would mainly inflate the accumulated return, resulting in larger negative action values for the visited states. As long as we do NOT find the goal, action values will correlate with the time limit. If we find the goal reproducible, the action values will drift towards their true optimal value independently from the time limit.\n",
