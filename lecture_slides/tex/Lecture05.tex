%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Temporal-difference learning and the previous methods}
Temporal-difference (TD) learning combines the previous ideas introduced in DP and MC:
\begin{itemize}
	\item From Monte Carlo (MC) methods: Learns directly from experience.
	\item From dynamic programming (DP): Updates estimates based on other learned estimates (bootstrap).
\end{itemize}
\pause
\vspace{1cm}
Hence, TD characteristics are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Allows model-free prediction and control in unknown MDPs.
	\item Updates policy evaluation and improvement in an online fashion (i.e., not per episode) by bootstrapping. 
	\item Still assumes  finite MDP problems (or problems close to that).
\end{itemize}

Recap the every-visit MC update rule \eqref{eq:inc_impl_MC_pred_non_stat} for non-stationary problems: 
\begin{equation}
	\hat{v}(x_k) \leftarrow \hat{v}(x_k) + \alpha\left[g_k - \hat{v}(x_k)\right] .
	\label{eq:MC_non_stat_up_lec05}
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\alpha\in\left\{\mathbb{R}|0<\alpha<1\right\}$ is the forgetting factor / step size.
	\item $g_k$ is the \hl{target} of the incremental update rule.
	\item To execute the update \eqref{eq:MC_non_stat_up_lec05} one has to wait until the episode's termination since only then $g_k$ is available (MC requirement).
\end{itemize}\pause

	\label{eq:TD_zero_update}
\end{equation}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Here, the TD target is $r_{k+1}+\gamma\hat{v}(x_{k+1})$. 
	\item TD is bootstrapping: estimate $\hat{v}(x_k)$ based on $\hat{v}(x_{k+1})$. 
	\item Delay time of one step and no need to wait until the episode's end.

Given a finite MDP and a fixed policy $\pi$ the state-value estimate of TD(0) converges to the true $v_\pi$
\begin{itemize}
	\item in the mean for a constant but sufficiently small step-size $\alpha$ and
	\item with probability 1 if the step-size holds the condition
	\begin{equation}
		\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}  \alpha_k = \infty \quad \mbox{and} \quad \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}  \alpha_k^2 < \infty .
		\label{eq:stoch_approx_condition}
	\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
Above $k$ is the sample index (i.e., how often the TD update was applied). 
\end{theo}\pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item In particular, $\alpha_k=\frac{1}{k}$ meets the condition \eqref{eq:stoch_approx_condition}.\pause
	\item Often TD(0) converges faster than MC, but there is no guarantee (see examples above and in Barto/Sutton book).\pause

\frame{\frametitle{batch training: ab-example (2)}
First, recap MC and TD(0) update rules:
\begin{align*}
	\mbox{MC}: \quad &\hat{v}(x_k) \leftarrow \hat{v}(x_k) + \alpha\left[g_k - \hat{v}(x_k)\right],\\
	\mbox{TD}:	\quad&\hat{v}(x_k) \leftarrow \hat{v}(x_k) + \alpha\left[r_{k+1}+\gamma\hat{v}(x_{k+1}) - \hat{v}(x_k)\right] .
\end{align*}\pause
Then, in steady state one receives:  
\begin{align*}
	\mbox{MC}: \quad &0=\alpha\left[g_k - \hat{v}(x_k)\right]=g_k - \hat{v}(x_k),\\
	\mbox{TD}:	\quad&0=\alpha\left[r_{k+1}+\gamma\hat{v}(x_{k+1}) - \hat{v}(x_k)\right] =r_{k+1}+\gamma\hat{v}(x_{k+1}) - \hat{v}(x_k).
\end{align*}\pause
Considering a batch learning sweep over $j=1,\ldots,J$ episodes:
\begin{align*}
	\mbox{MC}: \quad &0=\sum_{j=1}^J g_{k,j} - \hat{v}(x_{k,j}),\\
	\mbox{TD}:	\quad&0=\sum_{j=1}^J r_{k+1,j}+\gamma\hat{v}(x_{k+1,j}) - \hat{v}(x_{k,j}).
\end{align*}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Batch Training: AB-Example (3) %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{batch training: ab-example (3)}
Apply the previous equations first to state B. Since B is a terminal state, $\hat{v}(x_{k+1})=0$ and $g_{k,j}= r_{k+1,j}$ apply, i.e., the MC and TD updates are identical for B:
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	\mbox{MC}|_{x=\mbox{B}}: \quad &0=\sum_{j=1}^J g_{k,j} - \hat{v}(x_{k,j})\quad &&\Leftrightarrow \quad &&\hat{v}(\mbox{B})=\frac{1}{J}\sum_{j=1}^J g_{k,j},\\
	\mbox{TD}|_{x=\mbox{B}}:	\quad&0=\sum_{j=1}^J r_{k+1,j}- \hat{v}(x_{k,j})\quad &&\Leftrightarrow \quad &&\hat{v}(\mbox{B})=\frac{1}{J}\sum_{j=1}^J g_{k,j}.
\end{alignat*}\pause
This is the average return of the available episodes from \tabref{tab:state_reward_AB_example} , i.e., $6\times 1$ and $2\times 0$:
\begin{equation}
	\hat{v}(\mbox{B})|_{\mbox{MC}}=\hat{v}(\mbox{B})|_{\mbox{TD}}=\frac{6}{8}=0.75\, .
\end{equation}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Batch Training: AB-Example (4) %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{batch training: ab-example (4)}
Now consider state A assuming the steady state of batch learning process:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The instantaneous reward is always $r=0$.
	\item The TD bootstrap estimate of B is $\hat{v}(x_{k+1,j})=\hat{v}(B)=\frac{3}{4}$.
\end{itemize}\pause
\begin{align*}
	\mbox{MC}: \quad &0=\sum_{j=1}^J g_{k,j} - \hat{v}(x_{k,j})=\sum_{j=1}^J g_{k,j} - \hat{v}(A),\\
	\mbox{TD}:	\quad&0=\sum_{j=1}^J r_{k+1,j}+\gamma\hat{v}(x_{k+1,j}) - \hat{v}(x_{k,j})=\sum_{j=1}^J \gamma\hat{v}(B) - \hat{v}(A).
\end{align*}\pause
Looking at \tabref{tab:state_reward_AB_example} there is only one episode visiting state A, where the sample return is $g_{k,j}=0$. Hence, it follows: 
\begin{equation*}
	\hat{v}(\mbox{A})|_{\mbox{MC}} =0, \quad \hat{v}(\mbox{A})|_{\mbox{TD}} =\gamma\hat{v}(B)=\frac{3}{4}.
\end{equation*}
Where does this mismatch between the MC and TD estimates come from?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Certainty Equivalence %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Certainty equivalence}
\begin{itemize}
	\item MC batch learning converges to the \hl{least squares fit} of the sampled returns:
	\begin{equation}
		\sum_{j=1}^{J}\sum_{k=1}^{T_j} \left(g_{k,j}- \hat{v}(x_{k,j})\right)^2 .
	\end{equation}\pause\vspace{-0.25cm}
	\item TD batch learning converges to the \hl{maximum likelihood estimate} such that $\left\langle\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{U}, \hat{\mathcal{P}}, \hat{\mathcal{R}}, \gamma \right\rangle$ explains the data with highest probability:
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
		\hat{p}_{xx'}^u&=\frac{1}{n(x,u)}\sum_{j=1}^{J}\sum_{k=1}^{T_j} 1(X_{k+1}=x'|X_{k}=x, U_k=u),\\
		\hat{\mathcal{R}}_{x}^u&=\frac{1}{n(x,u)}\sum_{j=1}^{J}\sum_{k=1}^{T_j} 1(X_{k}=x|U_k=u) r_{k+1,j}.
	\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	\item Here, TD assumes a MDP problem structure and is absolutely certain that its model estimate describes the real world perfectly (so-called \hl{certainty equivalence}).

Similar to Sarsa updates, but $Q$-learning directly estimates $q^*$:
\begin{block}{$Q$-learning action-value update}
	The $Q$-learning action-value update is:
		\begin{equation}
		\hat{q}(x_k, u_k) \leftarrow \hat{q}(x_k, u_k) + \alpha\left[r_{k+1}+\gamma \max_u \hat{q}(x_{k+1}, u) - \hat{q}(x_k, u_k)\right] .
		\label{eq:Q_learning_update_action_value}
		\end{equation}
		This is an \hl{off-policy} update, since the optimal action-value function is updated independent of a given behavior policy.
	\end{block}\pause
Requirement for $Q$-learning control:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Coverage: behavior policy $b$  has nonzero probability of selecting actions that might be taken by the target policy $\pi$.
	\item Consequence: behavior policy $b$ is soft (e.g., $\varepsilon$-soft).  
	\item Step-size requirements \eqref{eq:stoch_approx_condition} regarding $\alpha$ apply.

%% Maximization Bias %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Maximization bias}
All control algorithms discussed so far \hl{involve maximization operations}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $Q$-learning: target policy is greedy and directly uses $\max$ operator for action-value updates.
	\item Sarsa: typically uses an $\varepsilon$-greedy framework, which also involves $\max$ updates during policy improvement.
\end{itemize}\pause
This can lead to a significant \hl{positive bias}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Maximization over sampled values is used implicitly as an estimate of the maximum value.
	\item This issue is called \hl{maximization bias}.
\end{itemize}\pause
Small example:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Consider a single state $x$ with multiple possible actions $u$.
	\item The true action values are all $q(x,u)=0$ .
	\item The sampled estimates $\hat{q}(x,u)$ are uncertain, i.e., randomly distributed. Some samples are above and below zero.
	\item Consequence: The maximum of the estimate is positive.
\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Double Learning Approach %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Double learning approach}

Split the learning process:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Divide sampled experience into two sets.
	\item Use sets to estimate independent estimates $\hat{q}_1(x,u)$ and $\hat{q}_2(x,u)$.
\end{itemize}\pause
\vspace{0.5cm}
Assign specific tasks to each estimate:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Estimate the maximizing action: 
	\begin{equation}
		 u^*=\argmax_u \hat{q}_1(x,u) .
	\end{equation}\pause
	\item Estimate corresponding action value: 
	\begin{equation}
		q(x,u^*) \approx \hat{q}_2(x,u^*)= \hat{q}_2(x,\argmax_u \hat{q}_1(x,u)) .
	\end{equation}\pause
	\item Doubles memory requirements, but amount of computation per step remains the same.

\begin{itemize}
	\item TD unites two key characteristics from DP and MC:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item From MC: Sample-based updates (i.e., operating in unknown MDPs).
		\item From DP: Update estimates based on other estimates (bootstrapping).
	\end{itemize}\pause
	\item TD allows certain simplifications and improvements compared to MC:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Updates are available after each step and not after each episode.\pause
		\item Off-policy learning comes without importance sampling.\pause
		\item Exploits MDP formalism by maximum likelihood estimates. \pause
		\item Hence, TD prediction and control exhibit a high applicability for many problems.\pause
	\end{itemize}
	\item Batch training can be used when only limited experience is available, i.e., the available samples are re-processed again and again.\pause
	\item Greedy policy improvements can lead to maximization biases and, therefore, slow down the learning process. \pause
	\item TD requires careful tuning of learning parameters:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Step size $\alpha$: how to tune convergence rate vs. uncertainty / accuracy?
		\item Exploration vs. exploitation: how to visit all state-action pairs?
	\end{itemize}
