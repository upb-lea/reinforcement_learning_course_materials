\begin{block}{What you should have learned}
\begin{itemize}
	\item How to model decision processes using a Markov framework. \pause
	\item Finding exact solutions using iterative tabular methods for (small) discrete problem spaces.  \pause
	\item Finding approximate solutions for large discrete or continuous problem spaces based on function approximation.  \pause
	\item Application of just these techniques on a practical programming level.\pause
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Concluding remarks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item This is an introductory course to reinforcement learning. We have only scratched the surface. \pause
	\item Some aspects, especially within the exercises, had a control focus. In other application, specific RL solutions can look quite different.  \pause
	\item If you are interested in more practical RL insights in the field of electrical power systems, do not hesitate to contact us.
