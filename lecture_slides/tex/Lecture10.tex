Problem space: it is further assumed that
\begin{itemize}
	\item the states $\bm{x}$ are (quasi-)continuous and
	\item the actions $u$ are discrete.
\end{itemize}\pause
\vspace{0.5cm}
Today's focus:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \hl{valued-based control} tasks i.e. transferring the established tabular methods to work with function approximation.
	\item Hence, we need to extend the previous prediction methods to action values
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation}
			\hat{q}(\bm{x}, u, \bm{w}) \approx q_\pi(\bm{x}, u) .
\end{equation}\pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item And apply the well-known generalized policy iteration scheme (GPI) to find optimal actions:
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation}
			\hat{q}(\bm{x}, u, \bm{w}) \approx q^*(\bm{x}, u) .
\end{equation}

	\item Middle: one function with $i=1,2,\ldots$ outputs covering the action space (e.g. ANN with appropriate output layer)
	\item Right: multiple (sub-)functions one for each possible action $u_i$ (e.g. multitude of linear approximators in small action spaces)

%% Feature Engineering %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Feature Engineering}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Also for action-value estimation a proper feature engineering (FE) is of vital importance.
	\item Compared to the state-value prediction, the action becomes part of the FE processing: 
\begin{equation}
	\hat{q}(\bm{x}, u, \bm{w}) = \hat{q}\left(\bm{f}\left(\bm{x}, u\right), \bm{w}\right) .
\end{equation}
	\item Above, $\bm{f}(\bm{x},u)\in\mathbb{R}^\kappa$ is the FE function.\pause
	\item \hl{For sake of notation simplicity we write $\hat{q}(\bm{x}, u, \bm{w})$ and understand that FE has already been considered (i.e. is a part of $\hat{q}$).}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Transferring the objective \eqref{eq:VE_J} from on-policy prediction to control yields:
\begin{equation}
	J(\bm{w})= \sum_k \left[q_{\pi}(\bm{x}_k, u_k) - \hat{q}(\bm{x}_k, u_k, \bm{w})\right]^2 .
\label{eq:VE_J_action}
\end{equation}\pause
\item Analogous, the (semi-)gradient-based parameter update from \eqref{eq:gradient_param_value} is also applied to action values:
 \begin{equation}
	 \bm{w}_{k+1} = \bm{w}_{k} + \alpha\left[q_\pi(\bm{x}_k, u_k) - \hat{q}(\bm{x}_k, u_k, \bm{w}_k)\right]\nabla_{\bm{w}} \hat{q}(\bm{x}_k, u_k, \bm{w}_k) .
	\label{eq:gradient_param_value_action}
 \end{equation}\pause
\item Depending on the control approach, the true target $q_\pi(\bm{x}_k, u_k)$ is approximated by:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Monte Carlo: full episodic return $q_\pi(\bm{x}_k, u_k) \approx g$,\pause
	\item Sarsa: one-step bootstrapped estimate $q_\pi(\bm{x}_k, u_k) \approx r_{k+1}+\gamma\hat{q}(\bm{x}_{k+1}, u_{k+1}, \bm{w}_k)$,\pause
	\item $n$-step Sarsa: $q_\pi(\bm{x}_k, u_k) \approx r_{k+1}+\gamma r_{k+2}+\cdots+\gamma^{n-1} r_{k+n}+\gamma^n\hat{q}(\bm{x}_{k+n}, u_{k+n}, \bm{w}_{k+n-1})$.

	\item Hence, when reacting to one specific state-action transition other parts of the state-action space within $\hat{q}$ are affected too. \pause

%% Average Reward %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{The Average Reward Definition}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is an alternative performance metric in continuing tasks.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Recall: discounting helped us to limit $v<\infty$. \pause
	\end{itemize}
	\item Alternative viewpoint: why value rewards further in the future less?\pause
\end{itemize}
\setcounter{mydefi}{0}
\begin{defi}{Average reward}{avg_return}
In continuing tasks the average reward is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\overline{r}_\pi &= \lim_{h\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{h}\sum_{k=1}^{h}\E{R_k|\bm{X}_0, U_{0:k-1}\sim\pi},\\
		&=\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\E{R_k|\bm{X}_0, U_{0:k-1}\sim\pi},\\
		&=\int_\mathcal{X}\mu_\pi(\bm{x})\sum_u\pi(u|\bm{x})\int_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{R}}p(\bm{x}', r|\bm{x},u)r.
	\end{split}	
	\label{eq:avg_return}
\end{equation}
for policy $\pi$ with $\mu_\pi$ being the steady-state distribution $\mu_\pi(\bm{x})=\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\Pb{\bm{X}_k=\bm{x}|U_{0:k-1}\sim\pi}$ (long-term state distribution).
\end{defi}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Equivalence in terms of optimality (1)%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Equivalence in Terms of Optimality (1)}
To compare the average reward against the usual discounted reward setting in continuing tasks when utilizing function approximation, we introduce the performance metric
\begin{equation}
	J_\pi = \int_\mathcal{X}\mu_\pi(\bm{x})v_\pi^\gamma(\bm{x}) .
	\label{eq:metric_avg_return}
\end{equation}
Here, $v_\pi^\gamma$ is the usual discounted value and, therefore, \eqref{eq:metric_avg_return} evaluates the long-term value following $\pi$. \pause Applying the Bellman equation we receive:
\begin{equation}
	J_\pi = \int_\mathcal{X}\mu_\pi(\bm{x})\sum_u\pi(u|\bm{x})\int_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{R}}p(\bm{x}', r|\bm{x},u)\left[r + \gamma v_\pi^\gamma(\bm{x}')\right] .
\end{equation}\pause
Inserting the average reward $\overline{r}_\pi$ definition \eqref{eq:avg_return} produces:
\begin{equation}
	J_\pi = \overline{r}_\pi + \int_\mathcal{X}\mu_\pi(\bm{x})\sum_u\pi(u|\bm{x})\int_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{R}}p(\bm{x}', r|\bm{x},u) \gamma v_\pi^\gamma(\bm{x}').
	\label{eq:prev_avg_return_comp}
\end{equation}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Equivalence in terms of optimality (2)%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Equivalence in Terms of Optimality (2)}
In the last equation \eqref{eq:prev_avg_return_comp} the term
\begin{equation*}
	\int_\mathcal{X}\mu_\pi(\bm{x})\sum_u\pi(u|\bm{x})\int_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{R}}p(\bm{x}', r|\bm{x},u)
\end{equation*}
combines the steady-state distribution $\mu_\pi(\bm{x})$ with the likelihood of transitioning to $\bm{x}'$ and receiving $r$ when taking an action $u\sim\pi(\bm{x})$.\pause If one assumes that the long-term distribution $\mu_\pi(\bm{x})$ is independent from the starting state $\bm{x}_0$, i.e. \hl{the underlying MDP is an ergodic process}, then  
\begin{equation}
\int_\mathcal{X}\mu_\pi(\bm{x})\sum_u\pi(u|\bm{x})\int_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{R}}p(\bm{x}', r|\bm{x},u) \gamma v_\pi^\gamma(\bm{x}') = \gamma\int_{\mathcal{X}}v_\pi^\gamma(\bm{x}')\mu_\pi(\bm{x}')
\label{eq:prev_avg_return_ergodic}
\end{equation}
holds since it does not make any difference if we start from $\bm{x}$ or $\bm{x}'$.
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Equivalence in terms of optimality (3)%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Equivalence in Terms of Optimality (3)}
Inserting \eqref{eq:prev_avg_return_ergodic} into \eqref{eq:prev_avg_return_comp} yields:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	J_\pi &= \overline{r}_\pi +\gamma\int_{\mathcal{X}}v_\pi^\gamma(\bm{x}')\mu_\pi(\bm{x}'),\\
				&= \overline{r}_\pi +\gamma J_\pi,\\
				&=\overline{r}_\pi +\gamma \overline{r}_\pi+ \gamma^2 J_\pi,\\
				&=\cdots\\
				&=\frac{1}{1-\gamma}\overline{r}_\pi.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\hl{Take away observations:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The on-policy discounted value equals the scaled discounted average reward (for on-policy continuing task methods). \pause
	\item Hence, ordering of all policies based on $\overline{r}_\pi$ would be exactly the same as using the discounted value $v_\pi^\gamma$. \pause
	\item Discount factor $\gamma$ changes from a problem to a solution parameter. 
\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Introducing the Differential Return %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Introducing the Differential Return}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Since discounting is not used in the average reward definition we have to reformulate the return and value definitions. \pause
	\item Intuitive approach: introduce \hl{differential quantities} describing the deviations towards $\overline{r}_\pi$. \pause
	\item Differential return:
	\begin{equation}
		G_k = R_{k+1}-\overline{r}_\pi + R_{k+2}-\overline{r}_\pi+R_{k+3}-\overline{r}_\pi+\ldots
		\label{eq:differential_return}
	\end{equation}\pause
	\item Differential value functions:
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
				v_\pi(\bm{x})&=\El{G_k|\bm{X}_k=\bm{x}}{\pi},\\
				q_\pi(\bm{x}, u) &= \El{G_k|\bm{X}_k=\bm{x},U_k=u}{\pi}.
		\end{split}
	\end{equation}\pause
	\item Accordingly, the Bellman equations require adaption (cf. chapter 10.3 in lecture book of Barto/Sutton, 2018).
\end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{Integrating the Average Reward into RL Solutions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Based on the differential return \eqref{eq:differential_return} we can reintroduce the TD error in combination with function approximation:
		\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
				\delta_k &= r_{k+1}-\hat{\overline{r}}_k + \hat{v}(\bm{x}_{k+1},\bm{w}_k) - \hat{v}(\bm{x}_{k},\bm{w}_k),\\
				\delta_k &= r_{k+1}-\hat{\overline{r}}_k + \hat{q}(\bm{x}_{k+1},u_{k+1}, \bm{w}_k) - \hat{q}(\bm{x}_{k},u_{k}, \bm{w}_k).\\
		\end{split}
	\end{equation}
		\item Here, $\hat{\overline{r}}_k$ is an estimate of $\overline{r}_\pi$ at time step $k$ (e.g. by a moving average filter).\pause
		\item And finally the semi-gradient-based parameter update is:
		\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
				\bm{w}_{k+1} &= \bm{w}_k + \alpha \delta_k\nabla_{\bm{w}} \hat{v}(\bm{x}_{k},\bm{w}_k),\\
				\bm{w}_{k+1} &= \bm{w}_k + \alpha \delta_k\nabla_{\bm{w}} \hat{q}(\bm{x}_{k},u_k,\bm{w}_k).
		\end{split}
	\end{equation}\pause
	\item In the following we provide details on the differential Sarsa implementation, but nevertheless, the TD modifications for state-value prediction are straightforward.

What is the \hl{key motivation to use the differential returns} and not the discounted returns in continuing tasks?\pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item If one is interested in the long-term control behavior setting the discount close to one ($\gamma \rightarrow 1$) is required.\pause
	\item Depending on the application (reward feedback), the estimated values might become unfeasibly large numbers.\pause
	\item Even if the numeric stability can be maintained, learning might become slow. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Recall again: discounting in continuing tasks is numerically limiting $v$.
		\item Hence we have to face a trade off: numeric stability vs. long-term estimation capabilities.\pause
	\end{itemize}
	\item Average rewards can be considered numerically more robust.\pause
\end{itemize}
Moreover, $n$-step bootstrapping  can be implemented as well:
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
				G_{k:k+n} &= r_{k+1}-\hat{\overline{r}}_{k+n-1} + \ldots + r_{n+1}-\hat{\overline{r}}_{k+n-1} + \hat{q}(\bm{x}_{k+n}, u_{k+n}, \bm{w}_{k+n-1}),\\
				\delta_k &= G_{k:k+n} - \hat{q}(\bm{x}_{k},u_{k}, \bm{w}_k).

%% Transfering LSTD-Style Batch Learning to Action Values %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Transferring LSTD-Style Batch Learning to Action Values}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In the previous lecture we developed a closed-form batch learning tool, LSTD, which estimated the state values of a given policy if
	\begin{itemize}
		\item we use linear function approximation and
		\item a fixed, representative data set $\bm{\mathcal{D}}$ is given.
	\end{itemize}\pause
\item Same idea can be transferred to action values when bootstrapping with one-step Sarsa -- called \hl{LS-Sarsa} (or sometimes LSTD$Q$):
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	q_\pi(\bm{x}_k, u_k) &\approx r_{k+1}+\gamma\hat{q}(\bm{x}_{k+1}, u_{k+1}, \bm{w}_k),\\
	\hat{q}(\bm{x}_k, u_k, \bm{w}_k)&=\hat{q}(\tilde{\bm{x}}_k, \bm{w}_k)= \tilde{\bm{x}}\T_k\bm{w}_k .
\end{split}
\label{eq:bootstrapping_LSTDQ}
\end{equation}
\pause\vspace{-0.2cm} 
\item The cost function for action-value prediction is then:
\begin{equation}
	J(\bm{w}) = \sum_k \left[r_{k+1} - \left(\tilde{\bm{x}}\T_{k} - \gamma \tilde{\bm{x}}\T_{k+1}\right)\bm{w}\right]^2.
\end{equation}\pause\vspace{-0.2cm} 
\item Hence, the closed-form least squares solution for the action values is the same as for the state value case but the feature vector depends also on the actions:
\begin{equation*}
	\tilde{\bm{x}}_k = \bm{f}(\bm{x}_k, u_k).
\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% On and Off-Policy LSTDQ %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{On and Off-Policy LS-Sarsa}
With $b$ samples we can form a target vector $\bm{y}$ and regressor matrix $\bm{\Xi}$:
\begin{equation}
	\bm{y} = \begin{bmatrix} r_1 \\ r_2 \\ \vdots \\ r_b \end{bmatrix}, \quad \bm{\Xi}=\begin{bmatrix} \left(\tilde{\bm{x}}\T_{0} - \gamma \tilde{\bm{x}}\T_{1}\right) \\ \left(\tilde{\bm{x}}\T_{1} - \gamma \tilde{\bm{x}}\T_{2}\right)\\ \vdots \\\left(\tilde{\bm{x}}\T_{b-1} - \gamma \tilde{\bm{x}}\T_{b}\right) \end{bmatrix}\, .
	\label{eq:LSTDQ_data}
\end{equation}\pause
Regarding the data input to $\bm{\Xi}$ we can distinguish two cases: The actions $u_k$ and $u_{k+1}$ in the feature pair $\left(\tilde{\bm{x}}\T_{k} - \gamma \tilde{\bm{x}}\T_{k+1}\right)$ per row in $\bm{\Xi}$ either descends from the
\begin{itemize}
	\item \hl{same policy $\pi$ (on-policy learning)} or \pause
	\item the action $u_{k+1}$ in $\tilde{\bm{x}}_{k+1} = \bm{f}(\bm{x}_{k+1}, u_{k+1})$ is chosen based on an \hl{arbitrary policy $\pi'$ (off-policy learning)}. 
\end{itemize}\pause
If we apply off-policy LS-Sarsa then
\begin{itemize}
	\item we retrieve the flexibility to collect training samples arbitrarily
	\item at the cost of an estimation bias based on the sampling distribution.
\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% On and Off-Policy LSTDQ %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{LS-Sarsa}
\begin{block}{LS-Sarsa solution}
Having arranged $i=1,\ldots,b$ samples $\left\langle \bm{x}_i, u_i, r_{i+1}, \bm{x}_{i+1}, u_{i+1}\right\rangle\sim\bm{\mathcal{D}}$ using one-step bootstrapping \eqref{eq:bootstrapping_LSTDQ} and linear function approximation as in \eqref{eq:LSTDQ_data}, the LS-Sarsa solution is
\begin{equation}
		\bm{w}^* = (\bm{\Xi}\T\bm{\Xi})^{-1}\bm{\Xi}\T\bm{y} .
\end{equation}
\end{block}\pause
Again, basic usage distinction:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If $\left\{u_i, u_{i+1}\right\}\sim\pi$: on-policy prediction (as in LSTD)
	\item If $u_i\sim\pi$ and $u_{i+1}\sim\pi'$: off-policy prediction (useful for control) 
\end{itemize}\pause
Possible modifications:
\begin{itemize}
	\item To prevent numeric instability regularization is possible cf. \eqref{eq:Ridge_LSTD}
	\item Recursive implementation for online usage straightforward cf. \eqref{eq:RLS}
\end{itemize}

General idea:
\begin{itemize}
	\item apply general policy improvement (GPI) based on data set $\bm{\mathcal{D}}$ 
	\item policy evaluation by off-policy LS-Sarsa
	\item policy improvement by greedy choices on predicted action values
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}

Some remarks:
\begin{itemize}
	\item LSPI is an offline and off-policy control approach
	\item Exploration is required by feeding suitable sampling distributions in $\bm{\mathcal{D}}$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Such as $\varepsilon$-greedy choices based on $\hat{q}$ 
		\item But also complete random samples are conceivable

	\item Likewise the simple $\varepsilon$-greedy approach can be extended.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Often a scheduled/annealed trajectory $\varepsilon_k$ is used.
		\item Again referring to the Dyna framework, many more exploration strategies are possible.

	\item End-to-end learning of $\hat{q}(\bm{x},u)$ from monitor pixels $\bm{x}$
	\item Feature engineering obtains stacking of raw pixes from last 4 frames
	\item Actions $u$ are 18 possible joystick/button combinations
	\item Reward is the change of highscore per step

\frametitle{Summary: What You've Learned Today}
\begin{itemize}
	\item From a simplified perspective, the procedures from the approximate prediction can simply be transferred to value-based control.\pause
	\item On the contrary, the policy improvement theorem no longer applies in the approximate RL case (generalization impact).\pause
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Control algorithms may diverge completely.\pause
		\item Or a performance trade-off between different parts of the problem space could emerge.\pause
	\end{itemize}
	\item Differential-returns allow an interesting alternative MDP formulation for continuing tasks.
		\begin{itemize}
		\item The usual discounted MDP framework may exhibit numerical problems for $\gamma\approx 1$ (slow learning, unfeasible large returns).\pause
		\item Discounting is not relevant for the optimal policy order.\pause
	\end{itemize}
	\item Off-policy batch learning approaches allow for efficient data usage.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item LSPI uses LS-Sarsa on linear function approximation.\pause
		\item DQN extends $Q$-learning on non-linear approximation with additional tweaks (experience replay, target networks,...).\pause
		\item However, a prediction bias results (off-policy sampling distribution).
