Real-world systems are always subject to certain state constraints $\mathcal{X}$ and input limitations $\mathcal{U}$. Violating those can lead to safety issues.   
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	v_k^* &= \max_{\bm{u}_k} \sum_{i=0}^{N_\mathrm{p}} \gamma^i r_{k+i+1} (\bm{x}_{k+i}, \bm{u}_{k+i})\, ,\\
	\mathrm{s.t.} \quad\quad \bm{x}_{k+i+1}&=\bm{f}(\bm{x}_{k+i},\bm{u}_{k+i}), \quad \bm{x}_{k+i} \in \mathcal{X},\quad \bm{u}_{k+i} \in \mathcal{U}\,.\\

	\item Application of RL on technical systems comes with many challenges, e.g.,
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Safety limits,
		\item Real-time / computational constraints,
		\item Varying and/or partially unknown environments.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Real-world implementations often require more than bare RL algorithms, e.g.,
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Integration of available a priori expert knowledge,
			\item Combination with model-based control engineering tools.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Ideal integration of data-driven RL solutions together with expert-based control engineering parts is subject to many open research question.
